Project Title: ASIC Design & Layout of an ALU using Parallel processing techniques 

In this project we did the layout design and testing of an Arithmetic and Logic unit using the vector-array processor approach. 
Utilised Xilinx Vivido tool using VHDL for logic synthesis and Ngspice for simulations ,Magic tool for layout design and IRsim for simulations of layout.

The data path and Control path schematics are attached along with the detailed report.
